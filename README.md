### Consuming the Server with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode 🍴

Place yourself in *mcp.json*, make sure the server has been built (right now it's adjusted).

Adjust the "command" to point to the absolute path of your executable.

Open Copilot and select Agent in dropdown

Select the play icon. 

You should see the tool icon showing two tools.

Test it with a phrase like so "calculate 2 and 4". This should present a button that invokes the tool on the server.
